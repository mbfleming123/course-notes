        <h2>Software</h2>

        <p>Information which operates a computer, instructions dictated by code.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>operating system</li>
          <li>applications</li>
          <li>scripts</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Input &amp; Output</h2>

        <p>Information provided to a computer which is then processed is <strong>input</strong>.</p>

        <p>The results generated by a computer after it processes information is <strong>output</strong>.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Binary</h2>

        <p>A numeral system represented by ones (1) and zeros (0).</p>

        <p>This is the most basic 'language' a computer understands.</p>

        <p>Binary represents on-and-off electrical states which allow processors to work.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Types of Information</h2>

        <p>For a computer to be valuable, we must give it information to process.</p>

        <p>There are four types of data computers work with:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>numeric</li>
          <li>character-based</li>
          <li>multimedia (audio / visual)</li>
          <li>instructional</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Numeric Information</h2>

        <p>A sequence of binary can represent numbers in decimal (base 10), the numeric system we use daily.</p>

        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>Binary</th>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>10</td>
              <td>11</td>
              <td>100</td>
              <td>101</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <th>Number</th>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>5</td>

        <h2>Binary to Decimal</h2>

        <p>Converting binary to decimal provides us with numbers for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>mathematical calculations</li>
          <li>a foundation for representing other information familiar to humans</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Other Numeral Systems</h2>

        <p>If we can convert binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10), we can also convert these binary sequences to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>octal (base 8)</li>
          <li>hexadecimal (base 16)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These were used by programmers more frequently in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s due to memory limitations, and are still in use today.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Character-Based Information</h2>

        <p>Text is the best method of communication which allows humans to exchange information with a computer.</p>

        <p>We work with a <strong>character set</strong>, which maps the letterforms of a language and combinations of keystrokes to a binary sequence.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2><abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr></h2>

        <p>The standard character set used by computers is known as the <strong>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</strong> or <strong>ASCII</strong> (<em>ask-key</em>).</p>

        <ul>
          <li>128 characters &mdash; letters, numbers, punctuation</li>
          <li>binary ranges from 0000000 to 1111111</li>
          <li>includes 'control' characters</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In ASCII, 1110111 1100101 1100010 represents the word "web".</p>

        <h2>Instructing Computers</h2>

        <p>When we want to give a computer instruction, our sequence of human-readable characters become <strong>strings</strong>.</p>

        <p>Combinations of these strings form <strong>instructions</strong>.</p>

        <p>These compound instructions become <strong>programs</strong>.</p>

        <p>The syntax (words, punctuation) we use to write programs represents a <strong>language</strong>.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>

        <p>A <em>programming language</em> describes a specific set of words, punctuation and syntax used to tell a computer what to do.</p>

        <p>Languages can be categorized based on human readability or how a computer processes them.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Low-Level Languages</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>may be written in machine code format</li>
          <li>directly readable by a microprocessor</li>
          <li>code compiles to several (less than 10 lines) of machine code</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>High-Level Languages</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>written in a syntax closer to human languages</li>
          <li>compiled or interpreted</li>
          <li>code may compile to hundreds or thousands of machine code</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Compiled Languages</h2>

        <p>Programs written in <em>compiled languages</em> are translated into machine code (binary) before they can be run.</p>

        <p>Examples:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>Go</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Interpreted Languages</h2>

        <p>Programs written in <em>interpreted languages</em> are translated into machine (binary) line-by-line and executed immediately.</p>

        <p>Interpreted languages are sometimes referred to as <em>scripting languages</em>.</p>

        <p>Examples:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is code?</h2>
        <img src="images/01-what-is-code.png" alt="Bloomberg Businessweek: What is Code?" class="no-print"/>

        <p>Journalist and coder Paul Ford wrote 38,000 words, a double issue for Bloomberg Businessweek in June 2015 all about code (the noun) and the culture of those who code (the verb).</p>

        <p>You can <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">read it online</a>. And you should.</p>
