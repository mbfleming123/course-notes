        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>a high-level, interpreted language</li>
          <li>the secret sauce of web interactivity</li>
          <li>introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 (1995)</li>
          <li>commonly used in browsers for client-side scripts</li>
          <li>has gained popularity for server-side uses (i.e. node.js)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Client-Side vs. Server-Side</h2>

        <p><strong>Client-Side</strong> (a.k.a. front-end) refers to processing handled by a user's computer.</p>

        <p><strong>Server-side</strong> (a.k.a back-end) refers to processing handled by a web server.</p>

        <p><small>Programming for Interactivity focuses on client-side JavaScript.</small></p>

        <h2>JavaScript is not Java!</h2>

        <p>JavaScript and Java are not the same. They have different syntaxes and uses.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language. Java is compiled.</p>

        <p><small>Please don't say we are learning Java ... this is a teeny pet peeve. &gt;:}</small></p>

        <h2>Browser Wars</h2>

        <p>Netscape and Microsoft battled to dominate browser market share during the mid-1990s.</p>

        <p>Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer introduced proprietary HTML tags. They had (similar, but) competing versions of scripting languages, too.</p>

        <p>(As of January 2016, Microsoft has <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/the-sorry-legacy-of-microsoft-internet-explorer/">ended support for older versions of IE</a>. This makes cross-platform developing a little less of a headache.)</p>

        <h2>Standard JavaScript</h2>

        <p><abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr> (European Computer Manufacturers Association), through assistance from Netscape, developed a standard version of JavaScript in 1997.</p>

        <p>The standardized version is <strong>ECMAScript</strong>, but everyone still calls it JavaScript.</p>

        <p>The ECMAScript 6 standard was finalized in June 2015.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>ECMAScript 6</h2>

        <p>ECMAScript 6 introduces new features (some which fix JavaScript's 'weirdness').</p>

        <p>However, is not yet fully supported across browsers and servers.</p>

        </ul>

        <p><small>"Programming for Interactivity" will focus on using JavaScript up to version 5.</small></p>

        <h2>Considerations</h2>

        <p>JavaScript is standardized and widely adopted, but some users:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>may turn off JavaScript functionality</li>
          <li>surf with older browsers which may lack support</li>
          <li>lack bandwidth to download large scripts, libraries</li>
          <li>lack computing power to handle client-side processing</li>
        </ul>
